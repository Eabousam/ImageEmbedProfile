# Cancer WSI Embeddings Interpretation

This repository provides a framework to investigate how pathology whole-slide image (WSI) embeddings can be transformed into biologically and clinically meaningful signals. The project integrates ProV-GigaPath embeddings with multi-omics and clinical data to explore how computational image features relate to molecular alterations, pathways, and patient outcomes.

## Repository Structure

### Data

Raw image embeddings are obtained from ProV-GigaPath model analysis and curatedTCGA

### Analysis Files
